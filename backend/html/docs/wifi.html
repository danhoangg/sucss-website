        <h1>WiFi</h1>
        <p>To perform attacks against WiFi networks, you need the aircrack-ng toolkit. This is comes included in Kali
            but can also be installed on most Linux systems.</p>
        <p>If you're not using Kali, you'll likely want to install the toolkit, like so:</p>
        <pre><code># apt-get update
# apt-get install aircrack-ng</code></pre>
        <p>You will likely need a dedicated USB WiFi adapter unless the one in your computer support monitor mode. Check
            the aircrack wiki for supported chipsets.</p>
        <p>If using Kali in a VM you will <strong>need</strong> a USB WiFi adapter which needs to be passed through to
            your VM as a USB device.</p>
