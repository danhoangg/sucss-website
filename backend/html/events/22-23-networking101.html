   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   This session will cover the basics of Network and WiFi security, which is good to know, even if you hate networks with a passion. In addition, it will also introduce a couple of tools which are very useful for pretty much any cyber security setting: nmap and metasploit. As per usual, we will be on hand to help with the challenges and the infinite pain that VMs bring.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Prerequisites
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A Kali (or similar) VM downloaded and set up (we can help with this during the session, however it takes a long time to download).
   </li>
   <li>
    A basic knowledge of Bash.
   </li>
   <li>
    At least one USB-A port on whatever machine you use (for WiFi adapters).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   Challenges
  </h2>
  <p>
   There will be two different challenge sets, one focussing on a simulated "wired" network, and the others focussing on WiFi. Please note that the WiFi challenges will only be available for the duration of the session (since they need active wireless routers).
