   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   This week we will be covering the basics of network and WiFi security - showing you how to (legally!) infiltrate and attack the networks that surround you. All are welcome and the session won't rely on any prior knowledge. Several of the challenges are brand-new for this year (exciting!) so everyone should be able to learn something new.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Please note that most of this week's challenges will only be available in-person during the session.
