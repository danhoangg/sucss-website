   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this session we will follow on from
   <a href="./hardwarehacking">
    Hardware Hacking
   </a>
   and look at some of the reasons behind hardware and software vulnerabilities and mitigations that can be used to thwart attacks against them. Topics to be covered include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Basic CMOS and Logic design for ICs
   </li>
   <li>
    Signal propogation and timing
   </li>
   <li>
    Power usage of MOSFETS
   </li>
   <li>
    Execution flow and timing
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   This session will involve hands-on attacks on simulated hardware
  </p>
  <h2>
   Prerequisites
  </h2>
  <p>
   Prior knowledge of CMOS IC design is suggested but not required as we will cover
the basics in the session. Familiarity with C and low level systems will be very useful.
