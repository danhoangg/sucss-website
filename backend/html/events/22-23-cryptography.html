   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this session we will introduce the field of Cryptography and a range of common cryptographic
vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. Topics to be covered include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Asymmetric Encryption (RSA, SRP)
   </li>
   <li>
    Symmetric Encryption (AES)
   </li>
   <li>
    Signatures (DSA)
   </li>
   <li>
    Hashing (SHA-256)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   This session will involve exploiting on said algorithms.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Prerequisites
  </h2>
  <p>
   No prior knowledge is required for this session.
Some challenges can be done simply with a web browser,
others will require Hashcat and a scripting language,
so having a working Kali VM is highly recommended.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you haven't already installed Kali, please do so before the session:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">
     Kali VM
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
