   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   Have you ever wondered if your keyboard is secure? Does that question even make sense? Join Miłosz from WithSecure in an exploration of wireless keyboards in this story-driven guest talk. Based on real events from a large educational institution, this demonstration will focus on the KeySniffer vulnerability. Despite first being disclosed over 6 years ago, a sufficiently dodgy keyboard can still be acquired from the UK's major computer hardware stores.

  <p>
   As part of this session, one lucky volunteer will be given the once-in-a-lifetime chance to wield a cheap no-name wireless keyboard, or to plug in a non-descript USB device into their personal machine. Don't miss out on this unique opportunity!
