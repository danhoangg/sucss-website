   In this session, we will explore vulnerabilities in GSM and offer the chances to perform the attacks against a real mobile network. If performed successfully, you'll be able to decode messages sent over the network!

   Prerequsities
  </h2>
  <p>
   As we'll be in the Zepler Level 3 Labs, you don't need to bring any hardware, nor download any software this week. As this session is adapted from old content from COMP3217, you'll want some awareness of
   <a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/noteswiki/images/COMP6224-2021-Week4-Cryptography.pdf">
    basic cryptography
   </a>
   , and experience working with
   <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/">
    Bash

   and Linux.

  <h2>
   Warning
  </h2>
  <p>
   This session involves decoding data from a live environment.
   <strong>
    It is imperative that you adhere to the frequencies given on the day and do not attempt any attacks against other GSM channels.
   </strong>
   The use of the techniques explored in this session on real networks is an offence under the
   <strong>
    Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006
   </strong>
   , and can carry penalties of jail time.
