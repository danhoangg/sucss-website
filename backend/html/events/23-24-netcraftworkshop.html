   Challenges
  </h2>
  <p>
   In May 2023, American and European law enforcement agencies announced the seizure of the Monopoly dark market, less than 2 years after it launched, along with $53.4 million in cash and virtual currency, 850kg of drugs, and 117 firearms. Its operator, Milomir Desnica, is thought to have made at least $18 million in commission. The anonymity of Desnica would have been under constant attack: from thieves wishing to steal his Bitcoin, from many countries' law enforcement operatives wishing to lock him up and throw away the key, and from gangsters wishing to find him and force him to give up his Bitcoin. One small mistake could lead to the loss of his newfound wealth, permanent incarceration, or a tortuous, grisly death. Despite this extreme risk/reward ratio, many others are also brave enough to operate similar dark markets that are still live.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your challenge, after a short tutorial outlining and illustrating the concepts, is to spend an hour bullet-proofing your dark market and then defend it for 20 minutes against your peers, whilst discovering the identity of as many of their Hidden Services as you can. Netcraft staff will be available to help. Contract assassinations may lead to disqualification.
