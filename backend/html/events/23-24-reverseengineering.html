   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   Getting programs to misbehave is the basis of offensive security (and malicious threats). Unfortunately, we don't typically have access to the source code of said programs. Thus: reverse engineering. this is the act of looking at a compiled program, and attempting to understand how it functions, as well as attempting to recreate something close to the original source code. Once we know how a program functions, we move on to binary exploitation. This is the act of using carefully crafted inputs to cause a program to do something it wasn't intended to; the most basic of such attacks being a buffer overflow. We will be covering tools and techniques for both, as well as how to spot vulnerable code.

   Prerequisites
  </h2>
  <p>
   A Kali VM is recommended for this session. The following script will install the necessary tools for this session, it can also be found at
   <a href="https://go.sucss.org/binexp-tools">
    https://go.sucss.org/binexp-tools
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To install the tools, run the following commands in your terminal:
  </p>
  <pre><code>curl -sSL https://go.sucss.org/binexp-tools-raw | tr -d "\r" | tee "install.sh" | sh
source ~/.zsh/path
</code></pre>
