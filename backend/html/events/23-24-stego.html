   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   Steganography is the art of hiding information in plain sight. When applied to cyber security, it often refers to concealing data (with a special meaning) within
   <em>
    other
   </em>
   data - such as a hidden message inside a file. A recent, but growing, trend involves using steganography as part of a wider attack, such as to hide shellcode:

  </p>
  <p>
   When applied to CTFs, the use of steganography can make the process of locating a flag much trickier and more puzzling. Instead of the flag being available in the open, it could be concealed in an otherwise mundane file!
  </p>
  <p>
   In this session, we will explore the basics of steganography including what it is, how it came about, common tools used and how they are applied to data hidden in:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Text
   </li>
   <li>
    Images
   </li>
   <li>
    Audio
   </li>
   <li>
    Network Traffic
   </li>
   <li>
    Files
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   There is also an opportunity to make your own challenge and compete against others to win a flag worth
   <em>
    double
   </em>
   points. We will not be discussing mathematical approaches to steganography as seen in research and literature; that is above the scope of what we will look at. If you wish to explore
   <em>
    these
   </em>
   techniques, you're encouraged to do so when you make your own challenge.
