   Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itâ€™s important to know your target extremely well before you start an attack. You can find very interesting information that could possibly lead to an easier point of ingress.
  </p>
  <p>
   'Doxxing' is the act of performing open-source intelligence on a target to create a dossier of compromising material that will be published.
  </p>
  <p>
   The term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources as opposed to covert, clandestine sources. An open resource could be an email address that is publicised, whereas a closed resource is getting an email from a database dump (don't buy a database dump, it's a tad sus).

  <h2>
   What and Where to Look
  </h2>
  <p>
   Look for any information that could be weaponized (pictures of badges, email addresses, IP addresses, DNS information etc). Have a look at company and staff social media, the company website, newspapers, online publications, blogs, etc.

   SecureATea are a new (and fake) start-up with a revolutionary idea. It's got machine learning, blockchain, an ICO, all on 5G. However, for all the buzzwords, their security could use some work.
  </p>
  <p>
   The aim of the session is to use OSINT to find useful information about SecureATea's website. You do
   <em>
    not

   need to send any goofy requests to the website - much like last week's session, all you need is a browser and to explore what is online.
