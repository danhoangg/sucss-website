   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   This week we have a continuation of the talk two weeks ago from our sponsor, WithSecure!
  </p>
  <p>
   This talk will be a short session on how to deliver talks, and brainstorming ideas for talks.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is part of a collaboration with WithSecure, where you will receive expert training and coaching in conference-speaking, with the aim of submitting talks to the renowned cyber security conference BSides London!
  </p>
  <p>
   BSides London has speakers of all levels of experience, and we have already seen conference-worthy talks at our Member Talks session in December, so we highly encourage you to get involved with this opportunity. There is, however, no obligation to submit any conference talks - please just come along if you're interested!
  </p>
  <p>
   If you have talk ideas (no matter if they're in larval stages or already well developed) WithSecure is more than happy to help you workshop them.
If you did a member talk early in the year, it's probably a conference talk waiting to happen!
