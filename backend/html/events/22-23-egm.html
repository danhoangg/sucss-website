   EGM
  </h2>
  <p>
   This was is opportunity for members to join the committee and help run the society. At this EGM, we are electing one role:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Events Officer
    </strong>
    : The Events Officer is responsible for arranging both drinking and non-drinking events. They should come up with ideas for socials, promote the social events, and book venues where needed.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Each candidate will have the opportunity to present their manifesto to the society, with members allowed to ask questions at the end. Voting will use the First Past The Post voting system; the person with the most votes will win. Members can vote to Re-Open Nominations (RON) if they wish to. If RON has a plurality of votes, the election for that role will be re-run as a by-election at the next EGM. Voting will be open for 10 minutes after all candidates present their manifestos.
  </p>
  <h3>

   It is common in the industry - especially in consultancy - to talk about your research work or findings of a penetration test. If you're not confident with public speaking, this is a great opportunity to practice your skills! Those who take part will receive a flag worth 15 points on our flag tracker.
