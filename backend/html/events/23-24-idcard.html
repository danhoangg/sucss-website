   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   This week we'll be taking a look at RFID and NFC technologies that power most mainstream access control systems and ID cards. We'll show you how to clone some of the most common cards, why it works even with cards that should be secure, and even let you use some kit to try it out yourselves!
