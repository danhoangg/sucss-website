   Digital Forensics is rarely about Cybercrime, want to know the real story? Step into the crossroads of technology, law, and ethics. Using expertise as an academic and a hands-on private investigator this talk offers an exploration into the ever-evolving world of digital investigation.

   This talk is a journey through the intricate and often hidden landscapes of technology where digital breadcrumbs lead to startling revelations. Drawing on the speaker's extensive background, ranging from advising law enforcement agencies to cracking complex cases, to shed light on the current challenges and triumphs in the field.

   Central to her narrative is the case of the 'Smart Washing Machine' - a real-life detective story that showcases the unexpected role everyday devices play in modern investigations. Sarah will use this case as a springboard to discuss broader issues in digital forensics, including the need for robust ethical frameworks, the intersection of technology and privacy, and the ongoing battle to stay ahead of savvy perpetrators in an increasingly connected world.
