   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   SUCSS will be running a capture the flag competition on Wednesday 20 March 2024 (our last session before Easter), in B60, the new lab space. The theme is "reverse escape room" and the challenges will be made by members of the society, and will be a great opportunity to learn about a wide range of topics in cyber security. The challenges will be designed to be accessible to beginners, but also to be interesting to more experienced members.
  </p>
  <p>
   We'd love as many challenges as possible this year, and we can provide support and hardware where required - just ask! Let us know

    here
   </a>
   if you're interested in creating a challenge, but it's not a commitment. You can change your mind later, so please do get involved! Even if you think you don't know enough, or that your idea isn't good, give it a go - the committee are happy to talk through your idea and help you make it the best it can be. And did we mention there are extra flags for our flag tracker up for grabs, for those who make a challenge?
  </p>
  <p>
   There will also be pizza and pepsi!

    This session will run from 6-10pm in B60, the new lab space.
