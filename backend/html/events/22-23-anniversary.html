   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   SUCSS has come a long way since its inception 10 years ago on 15th February 2013. Fast forward 10 years and we've run hundreds of sessions, invited countless industry guest speakers, racked up tens of thousands of points on the flag tracker and consumed a lot of beer, pizza and Pepsi Max.

  <p>
   Current, prospective and alumni members, please join us on the 14th May in Below Deck to celebrate our society's journey over the years. Featuring party food, prizes, plenty of references to Dave, and a few surprises too! And of course, the bar will be open the whole afternoon.
  </p>
  <p>
   Have any memorabilia or photos from over the years? Have some long-lost committee documents or want to do a quick speech? Please get in touch and send over anything you may have.
