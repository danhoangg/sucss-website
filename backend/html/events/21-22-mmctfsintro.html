   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   For this session, we'll be giving more details about the Member-Made CTFs event taking place later this month. We'll be covering how to submit challenges, the acceptable formats of challenges, and how challenges will be judged. We'll also take any questions you have about the event, and are happy to look at any challenges you have started developing.
