   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this session we will introduce a range of common hardware vulnerabilities,
and physical attacks to exploit them. Topics to be covered include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Basic electronics
   </li>
   <li>
    Common debug and control protocols (Serial, SPI, I2C, JTAG/SWD, CAN)
   </li>
   <li>
    Timing attacks
   </li>
   <li>
    Fault Injection (FI)
   </li>
   <li>
    Side-Channel Power Analysis (SCA)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   This session will involve hands-on attacks on simulated hardware, as well as
demonstrations with real hardware.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Prerequisites
  </h2>
  <p>
   No prior knowledge of hardware security is required for this session, however
some understanding of the basics of digital hardware (as covered in
COMP1203 Computer Systems I or ELEC1202 Digital Systems and Microprocessors)
may be helpful, as well as a basic familiarity with Python.
  </p>
  <p>
   If possible, please install the following software before the session:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">
     Python 3

   </li>
   <li>
    Common Python libraries such as
    <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html">
     Matplotlib
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://numpy.org/install/">
