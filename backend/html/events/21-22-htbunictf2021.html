   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   As we did last year, SUCSS are getting a team together to enter the annual HackTheBox Uni CTF. There are only 10 spaces available, so we encourage the members to have some experience with CTFs and cyber security challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
   This a Jeopardy-style Capture the Flag event, meaning teams race to complete as many challenges as possible over the course of the 3 days. These challenges are categorised into Web, Pwn, Hardware and other areas, meaning a team with a range of skillsets is important. Jack will be around over the weekend to provide technical support (or helping with challenges if there are any remaining spaces in the team).
