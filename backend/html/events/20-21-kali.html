   Challenges
  </h2>
  <p>
   You can access the session through SSH.
  </p>
  <p>
   SSH using
   <code>
    <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a6d5d3c5d5d5cdc7cacfe6cdc7cacf88d5d3c5d5d588c9d4c1" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
     [emailÂ protected]
    </a>
   </code>
   with the password
   <code>
    this-password-sucss
   </code>
   . Anything on the network
   <code>
    172.19.0.0/24
   </code>
   is fair game to attack
   <strong>
    except
   </strong>
   for items named
   <code>
    sucss-kali
   </code>
   ;
   <strong>
    you must not attack these
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   There are five flags available in this session - they are of a higher value, as we expect the challenges to take longer than usual. There is a bonus flag worth 25 points for completing all five flags.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    This session will only be available until Wednesday 28th October at 6pm
   </strong>

   <a href="https://nmap.org/">
    nmap
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   A network mapper; this is an invaluable tool for networking purposes, such as checking what IP addresses are 'live' so to say and what services are running on a given IP address. Always a good place to start when checking over a range of IP addresses.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="https://www.metasploit.com/">
    Metasploit
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   The Metasploit Framework specifically is a tool for executing exploit code against a remote target machine. This will come in useful for a few of the challenges.

  <h2>
   Prerequisite Knowledge
  </h2>
  <p>
   This sessions assumes that you are familiar with a Unix shell. If you are not but wish to take part, we highly recommend that you read
   <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">
    the first three chapters of this crash course
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <h2>
   Prerequisite Technology
  </h2>
  <p>
   You will need to be able to use SSH.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are on macOS or a Linux operating system, you can use the
   <code>
    ssh
   </code>
   command in your terminal.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are on Windows, you can either use
   <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">
    PuTTY
   </a>
   by entering the details. You can also use the
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">
    Windows Subsystem for Linux
   </a>
   , which would then allow for the use of the
   <code>
    ssh
   </code>
   command.
