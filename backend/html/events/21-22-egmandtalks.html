   It is common in the industry - especially in consultancy - to talk about your research work or findings of a penetration test. If you're not confident with public speaking, this is a great opportunity to practice your skills! Those who take part will recieve a flag worth 15 points on our flag tracker.

  </p>
  <p>
   As someone with experience in and around cybersecurity in both a CTF and professional environment, I have experience in the function of web services. The specific role of webmaster is one in which I currently lack experience and would be very eager to fill and learn more about.
