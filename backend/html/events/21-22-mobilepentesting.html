   We're proud to invite Milosz from F-Secure to talk about mobile pentesting this week! This guest session will replace our usual session, but will still be held in 67/1037 from 6-8pm. Like usual, it will be recorded and livestreamed on our Discord.

   Overview
  </h3>
  <p>
   <em>
    "In this session, we will introduce the basic concepts of mobile application testing. We'll look at basic device setup and prerequisites, discuss common tools, and look at some of the common vulnerabilities found within iOS and Android applications. If the Gods of Technology permit it, the session will be accompanied by a live demonstration of some real-world vulnerabilities."

  <h3>
   Prerequesites
  </h3>
  <p>
   Due to time and logistical constraints, this session will mostly focus on demonstration rather than hands-on experience. As such, there are no hardware or software prereqs. Familiarity with the content covered in Web 101 and Web 102 would is recommended, but not essential.
