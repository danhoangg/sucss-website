   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   Traditional scams are moving off the public web, making them harder to find and take action against. Email, SMS and social media now account for a growing proportion of how scams and malicious URLs are distributed, requiring interaction from a real human before the criminal proceeds to share any details.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this talk, Bilaal from Netcraft (and former SUCSS committee member) will explore conversational scams, showing the wide range of sophisticated (and sometimes unsophisticated) scams conducted, how criminals try to evade detection, and how Netcraft built a highly scalable automated victim to directly converse with criminals to extract intelligence that can disrupt their operations.
