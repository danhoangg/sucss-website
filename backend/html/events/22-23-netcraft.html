   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   Initial Access Marketplaces sell intelligence along with the tools required for criminals to gain access and exploit computers and their networks without having to do the complex legwork themselves. Commonly sold items include access to pre-installed web shells, copies of RDP and SSH credentials, combo lists, validated account information and much more.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this talk, Harry from Netcraft will explore Initial Access Marketplaces, showing how criminals can gain access to compromised infrastructure, along with digging into how the access brokers verify compromises, and highlighting weaknesses in the access brokers which could lead to their business being undermined.
