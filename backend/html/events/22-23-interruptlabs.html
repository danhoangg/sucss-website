   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   Sacha from Interrupt Labs is joining us to present a short introduction to
reverse engineering and binary exploitation (or how to find bugs for fun and
no profit).
  </p>
  <p>
   Sacha is a recent ECS graduate and SUCSS member working at Interrupt Labs,
experts in vulnerability research (VR) who have a local office in Basingstoke.

  <p>
   We will be heading to the Hobbit afterwards for a casual social.
