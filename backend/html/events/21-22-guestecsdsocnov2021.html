    Passwords and Windows Security - Dr Denis Nicole
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Abstract:
   </em>
   Passwords are a nightmare for all of us, yet we are making little progress with replacing them. From the very worst 1234 PINs to our best effort 32 byte random keys, they give us grief. What can we do to secure ourselves? To secure our non-geek loved ones? How secure are real passwords? Do hardware tokens help? Why is Windows worse than Linux? Does BitLocker help, and how to avoid an Azure tenancy. How has Bitcoin made things even worse? We'll hack our way through the password jungle, before Bitcoin kills all the trees.

   <strong>
    Permissioned vs Permissionless Blockchains - Dr Leonardo Aniello
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Abstract:
   </em>
   This talk will start with a very brief introduction on blockchain, then it will elaborate on the differences between permissionless blockchain (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) and permissioned blockchain (such as those based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework). Trade-offs exist between the two; for example, while the former offers stronger decentralisation, the latter provides much better performance: the choice ultimately depends on the use case-specific requirements. Finally, a very concise overview will be given on the active research directions on blockchain within the ECS Cyber Security research group.
