   Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itâ€™s important to know your target extremely well before you start an attack. You can find very interesting information that could possibly lead to an easier point of ingress.
  </p>
  <p>
   'Doxxing' is the act of performing open-source intelligence on a target to create a dossier of compromising material that will be published.
  </p>
  <p>
   The term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources as opposed to covert, clandestine sources. An open resource could be an email address that is publicised, whereas a closed resource is getting an email from a database dump (don't buy a database dump, it's a tad sus).
  </p>
  <h2>
   What and Where to Look
  </h2>
  <p>
   Look for any information that could be weaponized (pictures of badges, email addresses, IP addresses, DNS information etc). Have a look at company and staff social media, the company website, newspapers, online publications, blogs, etc.

   Prerequisites
  </h2>
  <p>
   There are no prerequisites required to take part in this session. All you need it a web browser and a curious mind.

   Challenges

  <p>
   SecureATea are an exciting (and fake) start-up that launched in 2019 with a revolutionary idea. They've got machine learning, blockchain, an ICO, all on 5G. Now they're back for 2023: but hopefully they're a bit more secure this time.
  </p>
  <p>
   The aim of the session is to use OSINT to find useful information about SecureATea's website. You do
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   need to send any goofy requests to the website, all you need is a browser and to explore what is online.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are 4 brand new difficult flags to find this year, 23 in total.

   uses OSINT to help find people who have gone missing. They are there to help investigate missing person cases, as well as educate individuals on OSINT techniques.
