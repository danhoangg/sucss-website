   This week we have a talk from our sponsor, WithSecure!
The talk will be covering conference speaking, this will not only be a demonstration of best practices, but also give you the skills you need to present confident and engaging talks yourself. This is the first part of a collaboration with WithSecure, where you will receive expert training and coaching in conference-speaking, with the aim of submitting talks to the renowned cyber security conference BSides London !
  </p>
  <p>
   BSides London has speakers of all levels of experience, and we have already seen conference-worthy talks at our Member Talks session in December, so we highly encourage you to get involved with this opportunity. There is, however, no obligation to submit any conference talks - please just come along if you're interested!
